  - Implemented processing strategies:
    - "YoLo" (fully automated)
    - "Paranoid" (with verification checkpoints)
  - Added multi-model support with file allocation strategies:
    - Round-robin
    - File-size-based
    - File-type-based

- **✅ Multilingual Support**
  - Enhanced translate.py to handle any language pair
  - Added language detection and selection options
  - Implemented auto-detection capability
  - Maintained domain-specific terminology during translation

- **✅ Advanced Processing Features**
  - Added reasoning trace option

  - Created standardized intermediate JSON format

- **✅ Real-Time Progress Tracking**
  - Implemented WebSocket-based progress updates
  - Added detailed job status reporting
  - Created cost and time estimation for batch operations

### Pending (Phases 3-4)

- **❌ Prepare Training Data Interface**
  - Filtering, deduplication, and augmentation tools
  - Train/validation/test splitting
  - Dataset metrics and visualization

- **❌ Multimodal Support**
  - Image processing with vision-language models
  - Audio transcription and analysis
  - Combined text + image + audio processing

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Modular Architecture**: The codebase follows good separation of concerns with clear module boundaries.

2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/except blocks with detailed error messages and logging throughout the codebase.

3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Effective use of AsyncIO for parallel file processing and non-blocking operations, particularly in the batch processing functionality.

4. **Documentation**: Code includes thorough docstrings and comments explaining complex logic.

5. **User Experience**: Multiple interfaces designed for different user needs, from simple to advanced.

6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new file formats and processing scripts through the modular design.

7. **Dynamic Configuration**: Intelligent handling of available LLM providers based on environment variables.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Test Coverage**: No dedicated test suite or unit tests for critical components.

2. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables are loaded directly; could benefit from a dedicated config module.

3. **Type Annotations**: Could be more consistent throughout the codebase.

4. **API Documentation**: No automated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the REST API endpoints.

5. **Code Duplication**: Some logic is repeated between different processing interfaces.

6. **Resource Management**: No throttling or maximum file size limits for uploads.

7. **Security**: Basic API key handling could be enhanced.

## Performance Analysis

### Current Capabilities

- Can efficiently process files up to 100MB depending on available memory
- Supports concurrent processing of multiple files (configurable, default: 3)
- WebSocket-based progress tracking minimizes connection overhead
- Batch processing with parallel execution distributes workload effectively

### Bottlenecks and Limitations

- Large PDF or DOCX files can consume significant memory during parsing
- Limited by API quotas and rate limits of LLM providers
- No distributed processing capability for very large datasets
- No automatic cleanup of temporary files in the uploads directory

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Measures

- Basic input validation for file uploads
- Environment variables for API key storage
- Sanitization of filenames and paths
- Error message abstraction to avoid leaking sensitive information

### Security Recommendations

- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add file type validation and scanning
- Implement authentication for API access
- Periodically clean up temporary files
- Enhance API key management

## Recent Refactoring Impact

The April 4, 2025 refactoring has significantly improved the application by:

1. **Restoring API Key Detection**: Fixed a critical issue with dynamic model availability detection based on API keys.

2. **Enhancing the User Interface**: Created intuitive, step-by-step interfaces that guide users through the processing workflow.

3. **Adding Multilingual Support**: Extended translation capabilities to support any language pair with automatic detection.

4. **Implementing Multi-Model Processing**: Added the ability to use multiple LLM providers in parallel with intelligent file allocation.

5. **Adding Processing Strategies**: Introduced "YoLo" and "Paranoid" approaches for different user needs.

6. **Standardizing Intermediate Format**: Created a consistent JSON format for all processing stages.

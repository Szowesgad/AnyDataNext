# Development Stage Summary

## Overall Status

The core frontend workflow for uploading an audio/video file, configuring its processing, and initiating the backend task has been implemented and significantly refactored. Robust startup scripts (`backend-start.sh`, `frontend-start.sh`) have been created to streamline the development environment setup and execution, prioritizing `uv` for faster dependency management.

The project is now poised for an **initial end-to-end test** of this primary user flow.

## Recent Achievements

*   **Frontend Refactoring (`page.tsx`):**
    *   Aligned component interactions (`FileUpload`, `ProcessingConfigurator`) with expected data structures and props.
    *   Corrected state management for uploaded file information and job IDs.
    *   Implemented WebSocket connection logic for real-time status updates (backend is sending updates, frontend is ready to receive).
*   **Component Integration (User-side):**
    *   Assumed `Progress` component added via `shadcn/ui`.
    *   Assumed `ExistingDatasets` component placeholder created.
    *   Assumed `ProcessingConfigurator` updated to accept agreed-upon props and return the full configuration object on submit.
*   **Development Workflow:**
    *   Created `backend-start.sh`: Activates `.venv`, installs dependencies (preferring `uv`), and runs the Uvicorn server with clear instructions.
    *   Created `frontend-start.sh`: Checks backend health before installing dependencies (if needed) and running the Next.js development server.

## Current Focus / Immediate Next Step

1.  **Execute End-to-End Test:**
    *   Run `./backend-start.sh` in one terminal.
    *   Run `./frontend-start.sh` in another terminal.
    *   Open the frontend in a browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
    *   Attempt the full workflow: Upload file -> Configure processing -> Submit.
    *   Observe behavior in the browser (UI states, console logs, WebSocket connection) and both terminal outputs.
    *   Identify and document any errors encountered during this initial test.

## Upcoming Tasks (Post-Test)

1.  **Backend Endpoint Enhancement:**
    *   Modify the `/api/process-audio-dataset` endpoint in `backend/app/app.py`.
    *   Update the `AudioProcessRequest` Pydantic model to accept the *full* configuration object sent from the frontend (including `provider`, `model`, `language`, `keywords`, etc.).
    *   Ensure the backend correctly receives and parses these additional parameters.
2.  **Backend Processing Logic:**
    *   Implement the actual audio/video processing steps within `backend/app/utils/multimedia_processor.py` (currently a placeholder `create_audio_text_dataset` function).
    *   Integrate calls to external tools/libraries (e.g., `ffmpeg`, ML models via MLX).
    *   Refine the detailed status updates broadcasted via WebSocket during processing.
3.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   Implement the functionality of the `ExistingDatasets` component.
    *   Refine the display of processing progress and status messages based on WebSocket data.
4.  **Address Naming:** Clarify and potentially standardize the use of `job_id` vs `fileId` across frontend and backend.

## Known Issues / Considerations

*   The current backend endpoint (`/api/process-audio-dataset`) likely ignores or errors on the extra configuration parameters (`provider`, etc.) sent by the updated frontend during the initial test. This is expected and will be fixed in the "Backend Endpoint Enhancement" task.
